ACLs, and limited ACL modification.

shock_service commit: 08b9f0c6b690cf06c04604165b6534f6580295d5

NEW FEATURES:
- No need to specify file size when uploading a file.
- ACLs are now set by user, not by email address, so the AuthUser class is
	not necessary.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- Fixed a rounding bug such that retrieved files where the size % 100,000,000
	is > 0 but close to 1 are truncated.

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
- Copy a node when Shock supports it.
- ACLs via KBase groups when Shock supports it.
