NEW FEATURES:
- First release.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- N/A

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
- Remove need to specify the file size when uploading a file.
- Use KBase user name rather than email for ACLs.

Since the addNode(file) methods are going to be rewritten in the next release,
test coverage is not complete.
